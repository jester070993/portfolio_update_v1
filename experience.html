        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>As a now-aspriing web developer who majored in Sociology, I recently disocovered my passion web design and front end development. Hoping to incorperate my desgree with front-end development, I have a long term goal of becoming a UX designer.
        </p>
        <p>  I am a well-versed individual who has learn to adapt to each and  every siutation through and through - having  seen the ghettos of Thailand, to the huge mansions in Roppongi, Tokyo, treking through the mud in Israel,  backpacking across rural Japan and hiking the Na Pali coast. These expierneces helped foster the inidiviudal I am today. As a life long learner and having seen, befriended and worked with many different inidivials, families, cultures and traditions all across the glode, I feel as if no task  is too big for me to accomplish.</p>
          <p>Oh, and my favorite band is Phish.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <p>I want to learn to become an efficent, dedicated and innovative web developer in, but not limited to: </p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>React</li>
          <li>Vue</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Ideally, really like to work with clients in the Music or Art industry, as those kind of go hand-in-hand with the work I am interested in doing - creating visual web presentations and I feel as if these web design can really feed off of these two areas (music and art), creating a web design based off the feel, thoughts, presentation or imagry of the music/art.</p> 
        <p> Although I would not hessitate to work for a big-name company. Anything with a visual aspect. I'd like to help  create an online presence for those in need. Having grown up my whole life with the internet right by my side, what more is there to say. </p>
